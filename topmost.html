            Biden calls for ‘pause’ in the war for the first time
            President Biden has finally called for a humanitarian “pause” to Israel’s war in Gaza as the US presses to evacuate all of its citizens in the besieged Palestinian enclave.
            
            “I think we need a pause,” Biden said during a campaign speech on Wednesday, after being interrupted by a protester who urged for an immediate ceasefire.
            
            When asked what a pause meant, Biden said it was “time to get the prisoners out”. The White House later clarified that this was a reference to the captives held by Hamas.

            Angelina Jolie slams Israel, calls world leaders ‘complicit in these crimes’
            US actress Angelina Jolie has slammed Israel for its “deliberate bombing of a trapped population who have nowhere to flee”.
            
            “Gaza has been an open-air prison for nearly two decades and is fast becoming a mass grave. 40 percent of those killed are innocent children. Whole families are being murdered,” Jolie, a former special envoy for the UNHCR, wrote in an Instagram post on Wednesday.
            
            Since October 7, nearly 8,800 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks on Gaza.
            
            “While the world watches and with the active support of many governments, millions of Palestinian civilians – children, women, families – are being collectively punished and dehumanized, all while being deprived [of] food, medicine and humanitarian aid against international law,” she added.
            
            “By refusing to demand a humanitarian ceasefire and blocking the UN Security Council from imposing one on both parties, world leaders are complicit in these crimes.”

            Israeli gunfire kills Palestinian in occupied West Bank
            Israeli forces have killed a Palestinian in Qalqilya, in the northern occupied West Bank, and seriously wounded two others, the Ministry of Health said.
            
            Sources told the Palestinian WAFA news agency that a 15-year-old was hit by Israeli live ammunition in the thigh in the Nazzal neighbourhood of the city.
            
            More than 130 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli or settler attacks in the occupied West Bank, and another 1,860 detained since October 7.

            Both sides fighting with guns and words: Analyst
            The Israeli army has showcased what it says is a huge cache of weapons and supplies seized from Hamas fighters, including rocket launchers, rocket-propelled grenades, handguns, and assault rifles.
            
            The military wing of Hamas has also released a video that shows its fighters coming out of tunnels and attacking what appears to be advancing Israeli tanks. The group says it destroyed a number of armoured vehicles east of the Zeitoun neighbourhood in northern Gaza.
            
            Commenting on the footage, Mahjoub Zweiri, professor of Middle East politics at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera, “There’s no doubt the two sides are trying to present a different narrative to support their argument.
            
            “And also to send a message to their own bases in Gaza and Israel, and to the world, because everyone is trying to justify and defend their [actions].”
            
            Zweiri said Israel and Hamas see as crucial the timing of the release of any footage. “It’s a sign that they believe that this kind of images and narrative will be influencing future operations and political decisions,” he said.
            
            “It’s a fight of words between both sides, and it’s likely to continue reflecting what’s happening on the ground.”

            ‘Diplomatic clock is ticking fast’
            A former Israeli NSA has said Israel’s decision-makers should be more careful about advancing slowly inside Gaza as diplomatic pressure against the country is set to increase, jeopardising world leaders’ support for the invasion.
            
            “I don’t think the same as some of the [Israeli] ministers and spokesmen that this war can continue without what we call a diplomatic clock … there is a diplomatic clock and it’s ticking and it’s ticking fast,” Eyal Hulata said during an online press briefing on Wednesday night.
            
            “I am very attuned to what is happening in foreign capitals. There is a lot of support, but there are also increasing protests against us, and we know how this drill works. There will come a time where world leaders might think that this is problematic to them and even if it’s not justified, they will exert pressure.
            
            “So Israel has to be more careful about the time it uses.”

            Israeli air raid targets UNRWA school
            We’re getting reports that the Israeli military has targeted an UNRWA school in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza.
            
            Thousands of displaced people in Gaza are currently taking shelter in the school.
            
            The attacks come after five Palestinians were killed in an earlier raid targeting areas around that school.

            Countries severing ties with Israel
            Some countries are cutting off relations with Israel, in protest against its continued bombing and killing of civilians in Gaza.
            
            Jordan has recalled its ambassador to Israel, saying it would only return its envoy if Israel ceased the “humanitarian crisis it has caused”.
            
            On Tuesday, Bolivia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Freddy Mamani announced that the country had cut off “diplomatic relations with the Israeli state in repudiation and condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip”.
            
            Neighbours Colombia and Chile also recalled their ambassadors for consultations, condemning the killings of civilians in Gaza and calling for a ceasefire.

            Egypt will help evacuate “about 7,000” foreigners and dual nationals from Gaza, the Foreign Ministry has said in a statement.
            
            In a meeting with foreign diplomats, Assistant Foreign Minister Ismail Khairat said Egypt was preparing “to facilitate the reception and evacuation of foreign citizens from Gaza through the Rafah crossing”, adding the “number [is] at about 7,000” representing “more than 60” nationalities.

            Gaza mothers fear for premature babies as Israeli siege cripples hospitals
            Talia was born on October 6, one day before the start of Israel’s latest war on the Gaza Strip.
            
            Her skin has since lost the bluish tinge that had raised alarm among medics at the Nasser Medical Hospital in Khan Younis but her lungs are not strong enough yet to function on their own.
            
            Hospitals across the Palestinian enclave warn that fuel supplies are running dry amid Israel’s total blockade. Once the generators stop, newborns dependent on electric incubators for survival could die within minutes. Already, the fuel shortage has forced Gaza’s only cancer hospital to shut down.

            M&S forced to apologise, pull down Instagram ad
            British retailer Marks and Spencer has been slammed for a Christmas advert it put up on Instagram where hats in the colour of the Palestinian flag were seen burning in a fire.
            
            While the retailer deleted the post and issued an apology “for any unintentional hurt caused”, social media users called the ad “subliminally referring to the ongoing genocide in Palestine” and claimed M&S “deliberately ran this”.
            
            Almost 8,800 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7. The air, ground and sea attacks continue throughout the besieged enclave.
            
            The image posted was an outtake from our Christmas advert, which was recorded in August, with traditionally coloured red, green and silver Christmas party hats. However, we have removed the post following feedback.

            ‘It’s heartbreaking’: Ons Jabeur in tears over plight of Palestinians
            The Tunisian tennis star has said she is donating part of her WTA Finals prize money to help Palestinians after her first win at a tournament in Cancun.
            
            In an emotional interview after beating Marketa Vondrousova, Ons Jabeur fought back tears as she spoke about the continuing conflict.
            
            “I am very happy with the win but I haven’t been very happy lately. The situation in the world doesn’t make me happy,” the three-time Grand Slam finalist said. “So I feel like … I am sorry,” she said, as she took a moment to regain composure.
            
            “It’s very tough seeing children and babies dying every day. It’s heartbreaking. I have decided to donate part of my prize money to help the Palestinians. I can’t be happy with this win,” added Jabeur, a former number two who is lovingly known at home as the Minister of Happiness.
            
            “It is not a political message, it is humanity,” she said. “I want peace in this world. That’s it.”
            
            Ons Jabeur says she’s donating a portion of her prize money to Palestine:

            We’re seeing live pictures of crowds and vehicles convening at Rafah amid expectations that the border crossing with Egypt will open for a second straight day.
            
            As we reported earlier, the Gaza Borders and Crossings Authority released a list of 596 foreign and dual nationals from 15 countries who will be allowed to leave Gaza later on Thursday.
            
            Some 500 people, including a small number of wounded Palestinians, were allowed to leave on Wednesday when the border opened for the first time from the Gaza side since the war started.

            Indonesian Hospital could turn into a large morgue
            By Hani Mahmoud in Khan Younis, Gaza
            
            People are still living the horror of the two massive attacks on the Jabalia refugee camp which happened within 24 hours. All of the injured were rushed to the Indonesian Hospital, the only remaining operational hospital in the northern part of Gaza.
            
            The large number of injuries coming in forced the hospital to work some 50 times beyond its capacity due to a shortage of medical supplies and fuel. According to a statement made by the Ministry of Health, the hospital resorted to making a serious decision of shutting down the main generator due to an extreme shortage of fuel and only relying on subordinate, small generators just to keep the ICU running.
            
            We don’t know for how long the hospital can sustain itself. At any time during the day, we could hear an announcement of a complete shutdown of the hospital which would be a catastrophe. It would turn the hospital into a large morgue.

            By Hani Mahmoud in Khan Younis, Gaza
            
            There are reports that the Israeli forces are pushing deep into the northwestern parts of the Gaza Strip, namely the city of Beit Lahia, and from the northeastern side of the city of Beit Hanoon. In addition, there are movements from the southeast all the way to the west, cutting two major roads Salah al-Din Street and the coastal line of Rasheed Street.
            
            Israeli forces keep pushing deep from four different directions, squeezing the Gaza Strip. There are reports about intense fighting going on between the Israeli army and Palestinian groups in these areas, people being killed, more houses being destroyed and residents who could not flee caught in this war zone.
            
            The road to the southern part has been shut, there’s no way for people to leave. Whoever is in northern Gaza will remain there.

            Why are people in Gaza living in refugee camps?
            Israeli air raids continue to target refugee camps in Gaza, including three attacks on the Jabalia camp in as many days. But why are people living in refugee camps in Gaza?
            
            Gaza was part of historic Palestine before the state of Israel was created in 1948 in a violent process of ethnic cleansing, expelling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes.
            
            It was captured by Egypt during the 1948 Arab-Israel War and remained under Egyptian control until 1967, when Israel seized the remaining Palestinian territories in a war with the neighbouring Arab countries.
            
            More than 60 percent of Palestinians in Gaza are refugees, expelled from their homes in other parts of Palestine in 1948, in places such as Lydda (Lod) and Ramle, and now live just a few kilometres away from their original homes and towns.

            ‘What I see unfolding in Gaza and beyond is genocide’
            Israeli atrocities and attacks on Gaza that have killed almost 9,000 Palestinians in the besieged enclave since October 7 is “genocide”, a top UN human rights official, who stepped down at the weekend over the organisation’s response, says.
            
            Craig Mokhiber, who was the director of the New York office of the UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights, wrote in his October 28 resignation letter that Israel’s military actions in Gaza were “textbook genocide”, and accused the UN of again “failing” to act.
            
            “I feel quite confident as a human rights lawyer in saying that what I see unfolding in Gaza and beyond is genocide,” he told Al Jazeera.

            Fire exchanges at Israel-Lebanon border continue
            The Israeli army confirms that one of its drones has been shot down by a surface-to-air missile fired from Lebanon.
            
            In response, the military said it attacked the squad that carried out the shooting and the site from where the rocket was launched.
            
            This is the second time since the war started that Hezbollah has hit an Israeli drone.
            
            For the past three weeks, the Lebanese Shia armed group and the Israeli army have been engaged in skirmishes, relatively restricted in their scope and geography. But since last week, we have seen both sides firing deeper into each other’s territory, in a move that experts say marks a new level of confrontation.
            
            On Friday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is scheduled to give his first public speech since October 7.

            Israeli air strikes target Jabalia refugee camp for a third time
            Our colleagues at Al Jazeera Arabic are reporting that Israeli air strikes have targeted the Jabalia refugee camp for the third time in as many days.
            
            At least three Palestinians have been killed and many injured in the bombing of a house in the camp.
            
            Almost 200 people were killed and at least 777 wounded in the first two bombings of the camp on Tuesday and Wednesday. Another 120 people are still missing, according to a report published by Gaza’s Government Media Office.
